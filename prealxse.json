PBL is designed to provide learners with opportunities to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills, which are all essential for success in today's rapidly changing work environments. PBL at ALX SE‚Äã The ALX SE program follows a project-based learning model in which learners work on a series of increasingly complex projects, starting with simple ones and progressing to more advanced ones as they gain experience and proficiency. Unlike other educational institutions, ALX SE is not professor-led. So, you don't have teachers showing up to teach you. You need to learn by yourself, with your peers and with/without help from technical mentors.",

By providing real-world challenges and opportunities for collaboration, we are helping to prepare you for the demands of the modern workplace, where the ability to work independently, communicate effectively, and solve complex problems is essential for success. At ALX SE, the project based learning takes place on the intranet. What is the intranet?‚Äã The intranet is the online platform that serves as your classroom. On the intranet, you will find information such as: How to access the intranet‚Äã Before the official start of the program, you will be asked to set up your account on the intranet.",

You will also get an email notifying you of the availability of a new project. Do the projects have deadlines?‚Äã Each project has its own deadline and is also usually 6:00AM. The duration for a project depends on how loaded that specific project is. You may have some projects lasting for only 24 hours while others can last for about 2 weeks. What happens if you miss a project deadline?‚Äã If you miss a project deadline, you may lose points or receive a lower grade. However, the project will always be available for you to do it at your own pace. Project Deadlines‚Äã Each project that you are assigned has three (3) different deadlines.",

They are: At the end of the probation phase, which is the end of your first 6 weeks in the program if you are doing the fully remote program, you are required to have a minimum score of 80% Beyond probation, you are expected to get a minimum of 70% for each month in the program.

Peer learning involves the sharing of knowledge, skills, and experiences among peers, which helps to deepen understanding, reinforce learning, and build community. In the heart of ALX SE is rooted the concept of peer learning. Unlike other educational institutions, ALX SE is not professor-led. So, you don't have teachers showing up to teach you. You therefore do a lot of the learning together with your peers. Peer Learning Days (PLDs)‚Äã To facilitate peer learning in the ALX SE program, we have dedicated days for learners to host peer learning sessions or discussions. Even though these days are captured on the learners' calendars, it doesn't stop learners from organizing peer learning sessions amongst themselves on other days aside PLDs.",

Peer Learning is when you share your thought process - whether through conversation, whiteboarding, debugging or live coding. Examples: ‚ñ∫ Modeling this form of thinking for one another is invaluable, and will strengthen your entire cohort. ‚ñ∫ Your ability to articulate your knowledge (aka help teach others) will be required to succeed at a technical interview and a career in software engineering.",

The checker can give you feedback on what you did wrong if you end up not scoring everything. But most times the Checker's feedback is only available after your first deadline. Betty‚Äã Betty is a tool used for code checking and formatting (in C programming) It helps to ensure code consistency, readability, and adherence to industry standards.

During the quiz session, you are not allowed to open any extra materials on the device you are using. Leaving the quiz screen during the quiz session will result in loss of marks. The number of minutes spent away from the quiz screen will determine how many marks you lose.

This will enable you to work on your projects even if you don't have your own environment set up. While using the sandbox is highly recommended, it's not mandatory.

During the first few weeks of the program, we focus on helping you develop the right mindset to succeed and learn fundamental concepts such as version control and the use of command line tools. To get the most out of the program, we suggest familiarizing yourself with the following four concepts before starting: NB: Just familiarize yourself with these concepts (especially if they are totally new to you) By having a basic understanding of these concepts, you'll be better equipped to hit the ground running and get the most out of the program.",
